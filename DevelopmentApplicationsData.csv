City Planning staff are reporting to Toronto & East York Community Council on the findings related to the Planning Framework in June of 2021. Should Community Council endorse the planning framework, staff will launch Phase 2 of the study in Q3 of 2021. As part of Phase 2, staff will bring forward policies in the form of an Official Plan Amendment or Site and Area Specific Policy to implement the guiding principles of the planning framework.
